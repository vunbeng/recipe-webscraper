# recipe-webscraper
A Python webscraping script for the allrecipe website.

I'm a beginner in programming and was interested in webscraping. I had practiced scraping quotestoscrape, but that was too simple for me, so I decided to challenge myself with this project.

I think this project benefits well to those who are looking to find recipes to suit their nutritional needs, especially gym enthusiasts, as the script will create CSV files that have datas on protein and fat content, and other contents can be scraped with small adjustments.

This project was built in Python using libraries such Selenium and CSV.

SET-UP:
1. Locate the Chrome webdriver, or download one from their website
2. Change the wanted contents if needed
3. Run the code
4. Make sure to not turn off the machine as it takes a while to scrape through everything

ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS:
1. I think the code can be improved to be more efficient and quick as it takes a while to go through everything
2. More error handling can be implemented, especially for other meals, as the code was only tested on BREAKFAST AND BRUNCH
